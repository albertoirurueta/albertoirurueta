- 👋 Hi, I’m @albertoirurueta
- 👀 I’m interested in Augmented Reality, 3D reconstruction, inertial navigation, Android developement, microservices developement using Springboot and stuff related to ecommerce.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning stuff about microservice architecture and a little bit about machine learning, and I hope to have time someday to get up to date with iOS and web developement (either using React or Angular)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever I see useful in any of the subjects mentioned above.
- 📫 How to reach me: alberto@irurueta.com

Cool stuff I've done:
- 3D reconstruction: https://youtu.be/eD-kI6F3e_4?si=Mx_F-aNdkfOfdGpc
- Indoor navigation using wifi: https://youtu.be/GAvOyL0qYrw
- Feet Size detection using Augmented Reality: https://youtube.com/shorts/iI7l3vaDpsU?feature=share
- Android developement. Mostly it's normal stuff, but sometimes there's something cute like this: https://youtube.com/shorts/3zKiuTil4VQ?feature=share
